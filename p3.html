              <h6>How many Members of Parliament, men and women, are graduated?</h6>
            <p class="capital">The third research question focuses on the educational background of deputies, both male and female, 
              and seeks to determine the proportion of representatives who hold a higher education degree.   
              By examining the data, we can gain insights into the educational qualifications
              of deputies across different legislatures and explore any disparities between </p>

                <p>
                  Additionally, there is a general expectation that earlier legislative periods may have a lower number
                  of deputies with higher education degrees compared to more recent legislatures. This hypothesis stems
                   from historical context, as educational attainment was relatively lower in the past century compared to recent
                    times, where higher education has become more accessible.
                          In the early years, during the "Costituente" and the first few legislatures, a significant proportion of 
                          male deputies did not hold higher education degrees. In the "Costituente," there were 413 deputies with 
                          higher education qualifications, while 151 were non-graduates, representing a considerable disparity.

            genders. It is hypothesized that a significant proportion of female deputies will possess higher
            education degrees due to gender disparities in society, where women may need to demonstrate 
            greater qualifications compared to their male counterparts. This is in line with the notion that
             women often face higher scrutiny and expectations in professional settings, leading them to pursue
              higher levels of education to prove their competence and eligibility for political positions.
            </p>
            </div>
                    <div class="col-2 article3m">
                  <p> However, as we progress through subsequent legislative periods, a consistent shift in educational
                     background becomes evident. From the 4th legislative period onwards, the number of "Graduated" male deputies 
                     consistently surpassed the number of "Non Graduated" deputies. This trend reflects a growing emphasis on higher

                     <div class="col-6 article3f">
                    <p>   education qualifications in political representation. By the 19th legislative period, the latest period covered in the data, the proportion of "Graduated"
                      male deputies reached 187, while the number of "Non Graduated" deputies decreased to 83. 
                      This transformation underscores a notable shift towards a more educated cohort of male deputies in the Chamber of Deputies.
                    Calculating the percentages of "Graduated" and "Non Graduated" deputies for each legislative period reveals 
                    the extent of this transition. In the "Costituente," approximately 73.2% of male deputies held higher education degrees, 
                    while the percentage rose to 81.0% in the 19th legislative period. Conversely, the percentage of "Non Graduated" deputies 
                    decreased from 26.8% in the "Costituente" to 19.0% in the 19th legislative period.

            <h6>Education analysis: <span class="red-text">Female data</span> </h6>
            <p class="capital">Turning to female deputies, we find a similar pattern of variations in educational qualifications across different
               legislatures. In the Costituente legislature, 12 female deputies were graduates, while 8 were non-graduates.
                Similar to male deputies, the number of female graduates increases in recent legislatures. For example, 
                in the 19th legislature, there are 92 female graduates and 37 non-graduates. This suggests progress in educational 
                qualifications among female representatives over time, albeit with smaller numbers compared to male deputies.
              Examining the total figures for all legislatures combined, we find that out of a total of 5,226 male deputies, 
              3,361 (approximately 64.28%) are graduates, while 1,865 (approximately 35.72%) are non-graduates. On the other 
              hand, out of 883 female deputies, 572 (approximately 64.77%) are graduates, while 311 (approximately 35.23%) 
              are non-graduates.

            <div class="col-2 articlef">
              <p> 
                This finding suggests that, proportionally, women were more
                 likely to have higher education qualifications during these specific periods.
                However, the data also reveals that in several other legislative periods, male deputies exhibited a higher percentage of 
                "Graduated" representatives compared to their female counterparts. For instance, during the 1st, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 
                9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th legislative periods, male deputies consistently had a greater representation of
                 higher education qualifications.
                The analysis of educational attainment among male and female deputies in the Chamber of Deputies, legislature by legislature, provides valuable insights into the gendered dynamics of representation and academic qualifications over time.

                <p> 
                  Upon further examination of the data, it is evident that the educational backgrounds and gender dynamics within 
                  the Chamber of Deputies varied significantly across different legislative periods. In certain periods, female deputies
                   had a higher proportion of "Graduated" representatives compared to male deputies confirming the initial hypothesis 
                   that women may need to demonstrate higher educational qualifications to be represented in political positions.

        <div class="col-2 article3m ">
          <p>
            Comparing the data for male and female deputies, a consistent pattern emerges. In the early legislative periods, both male and female deputies exhibited similar proportions of "Graduated" and "Non Graduated" representatives.
            During the "Costituente," approximately 73.2% of male deputies and 60.0% of female deputies held higher education degrees.
            As we progress through subsequent legislative periods, both male and female deputies showed a gradual increase in the proportion 
            of "Graduated" representatives, indicating a growing emphasis on educational qualifications for political leadership.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-2  article3m">
           <p>By the 19th legislative period, the latest period covered in the data, the percentage of "Graduated" male deputies reached 81.0%,
             while "Graduated" female deputies stood at 71.1%. The percentage of "Non Graduated"
             male deputies decreased to 19.0%, and "Non Graduated" female deputies decreased to 28.9%.These data suggest that female deputies tend
              to have a slightly lower proportion of "Graduated" representatives compared to male deputies. This observation aligns with the 
              initial hypothesis that women may need to demonstrate higher educational qualifications to overcome gender disparities in political representation. 

           </p></div>
           <div class="col-2 article3m">
            <p>
             
              Additionally, the comparison reveals that both male and female deputies experienced an upward trend in educational attainment
               over successive legislative periods.This shift reflects a growing recognition of the importance of higher education qualifications
               in political leadership roles, irrespective of gender. These percentages reveal a similar proportion of male and female deputies holding higher education degrees, indicating a relatively balanced educational profile 
               Specifically, during the 2nd, 3rd, 15th, and 19th legislative periods, the percentage of female deputies holding higher 
                education degrees exceeded that of their male counterparts. 
            </p></div>
          
            <div class = "col-2 article3su"><p> 
              It is noteworthy that despite this progress, both male and female deputies have faced challenges in achieving educational parity, 
              as evidenced by the proportion of "Non Graduated" representatives remaining above 10% in several legislative periods. </p>

            <h6>Overview graduated deputies in all legislature</h6>
            <p class="capital">Overall, the data highlights a positive trend in the educational qualifications of deputies, both male and female, with an increasing number of graduates observed in recent legislatures. While there are still disparities between male and female deputies, the proportion of graduates among both genders is relatively balanced.
              To gain a comprehensive understanding of the educational backgrounds of deputies, it would be beneficial to further analyze the data in conjunction with additional factors such as the parties they belong to or their roles within the Chamber of Deputies. This would provide deeper insights into the relationship between educational qualifications and political representation, shedding light on potential barriers or biases that may affect access to political positions.
              In conclusion, the provided data offers detailed insights into the educational profiles of male and female deputies in the Italian Chamber of Deputies, legislature by legislature. 
              While there are variations across different legislatures, there is an overall positive trend in the number of graduates among both genders.
               By addressing any existing disparities and promoting equal access to education, Italy can further enhance the representation of highly educated individuals within its political landscape.
