              <h6>How many Members of the Chamber of Deputies, men and women, are <span class="red-text">graduated?</span></h6>
            <p class="capital">The third research question focuses on <b class="red-text">the educational background</b> of deputies, both male and female, 
              and seeks to determine the proportion of representatives who hold a higher education degree.   
              By examining the data, we can gain insights into the educational qualifications
              of deputies across different legislatures and explore any disparities between genders. It is hypothesized that 
              a significant proportion of female deputies will possess higher
              education degrees due to gender disparities in society, where women may need to <b>demonstrate 
              greater qualifications compared to their male counterparts</b>. This is in line with the notion that
               women often face higher scrutiny and expectations in professional settings, leading them to pursue
                higher levels of education to prove their competence and eligibility for political positions.</p>
            </div>
              <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-8 col-sm-8 mx-auto"> 
                <p>
                  Additionally, there is a general expectation that earlier legislative periods may have a lower number
                  of deputies with higher education degrees compared to more recent legislatures. This hypothesis stems
                   from historical context, as educational attainment was relatively lower in the past century compared to recent
                    times, where higher education has become more accessible.
                    In our analysis of male representatives, we observe distinct patterns 
                    in their educational qualifications across various legislatures. On average, male deputies have a solid 
                    representation of higher education degrees, with an average percentage of approximately <b class="red-text">67%</b>. 
                    The mode, which represents the most frequent value, stands at <b class="red-text">69%</b>, and the lowest 
                    recorded percentage of male deputies holding higher education degrees is <b class="red-text">63%</b>, notably 
                    occurring during the XVI and XVII legislatures. These legislatures, with a lower 
                    representation of male deputies with higher education degrees, offer 
                  </p>

                  <p>   insights into 
                    the <b>complexities of educational attainment among male representatives</b> in specific
                    historical contexts.  Interestingly, these findings challenge our initial hypothesis
                     that earlier legislative periods may have a lower number of deputies with higher 
                     education degrees compared to more recent legislatures. 
                     However, the presence of the legislature I, with the highest percentage of male deputies
                   holding higher education degrees, showcases the variability in educational qualifications over 
                   different legislative periods. This indicates that <b>historical context alone may not be the sole
                    determinant of educational trends among male representatives.</b>

            <h6>Education analysis: <span class="red-text">Female data</span> </h6>
            <p class="capital">Turning our attention to female representatives and
               considering the provided data, we uncover <b>intriguing trends in their 
               educational backgrounds</b> across various legislative periods. On average,
               female deputies exhibit a unique profile, with an average percentage of
               approximately <b class="red-text">56%</b> holding higher education degrees.
               Delving into the specifics, we find variations in the data. The mode, 
               representing the most frequently occurring value, consistently stands at
               <b class="red-text">55%</b> or <b class="red-text">56%</b>, indicating that these percentages are frequently observed 
               across different legislatures. This suggests a recurring trend in
               educational qualifications among female representatives over time.
               Notably, there are instances of legislative periods where the educational
               profile of female deputies diverges. For instance, during the '11'
               legislature, we observe a significant increase, with <b class="red-text">70%</b> of female 
               representatives holding higher education degrees.
               This suggests a potential turning point or a unique context in that 
               legislative era. Additionally, the XIV legislature stands out as an 
               exception with <b class="red-text">73%</b> of female deputies holding higher education degrees,
               signifying a peak in educational qualifications during that specific period.
               While examining the educational qualifications of female representatives,
               we explore the hypothesis that a significant proportion of female deputies 
             </p>
          </div>
            <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-8 col-sm-8 mx-auto">
              <p>     
                would possess higher education degrees due to societal gender 
                disparities.
              This hypothesis was rooted in the idea that women often 
              face greater scrutiny and expectations in professional settings.
              However, the data analysis reveals a more complex picture. On average,
              female deputies exhibit an educational profile where approximately 
              <b class="red-text">56%</b> hold higher education degrees. While this percentage indicates 
              a substantial presence of educated female representatives, it falls 
              short of confirming the hypothesis of a 'significant' proportion.
              Moreover, certain legislative periods show lower percentages of
              female deputies with higher education  degrees, such as the XIV and XV legislatures. 
              These instances challenge the notion that 
              a uniform trend of higher educational attainment among female
              representatives exists across all legislative eras.
              In essence, the data suggests that <b>while gender disparities persist in society,
              the impact on the educational qualifications of female deputies in the political 
              arena is multifaceted</b>. While some female representatives do possess higher education 
              degrees, indicating their commitment to demonstrating qualifications, the presence
              of variability in educational profiles across different legislative periods
              underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of these dynamics. 
              Societal expectations and gender disparities may play a role, but they interact
              with other complex factors influencing the educational attainment of female
              political representatives.

              <p class="capital">
              <b>Overall Patterns</b>: On average, male deputies tend to have a slightly higher
               percentage of higher education degrees compared to female deputies.
                The average percentage for male deputies is approximately 66%, while for female deputies,
                 it's around <b class="red-text">56%</b>. <br>
                 <b>Variability</b>: There is notable variability in education
             qualification across different legislative periods. 
              Societal expectations, gender disparities, 
              and legislative contexts interact in complex ways to influence
               the educational attainment of political representatives.
                These findings emphasize the importance of considering nuanced 
                factors when evaluating the educational backgrounds of male and
                 female deputies in political landscapes.

            <p class="capital">Overall, the data highlights a positive trend in the educational qualifications of deputies, both male and female, with an increasing number of graduates observed in recent legislatures. While there are still disparities between male and female deputies, the proportion of graduates among both genders is relatively balanced.
              To gain a comprehensive understanding of the educational backgrounds of deputies, it would be beneficial to further analyze the data in conjunction with additional factors such as the parties they belong to or their roles within the Chamber of Deputies. This would provide deeper insights into the relationship between educational qualifications and political representation, shedding light on potential barriers or biases that may affect access to political positions.
              In conclusion, the provided data offers detailed insights into <b>the educational profiles of male and female deputies</b> in the Italian Chamber of Deputies, legislature by legislature. 
              While there are variations across different legislatures, there is an overall positive trend in the number of graduates among both genders.
               By addressing any existing disparities and promoting equal access to education, Italy can further enhance the representation of highly educated individuals within its political landscape.
               in educational qualifications
                  within both genders across different legislatures. Both males and females exhibit 
                  fluctuations in the percentages of higher education degrees over time.
              Legislative Periods: Certain legislative periods stand out. For instance, during the 
              '11' legislature, there is a significant increase in the percentage of females (70%)
               with higher education degrees, suggesting a turning point or a unique context for female
                representatives. On the other hand, the '14' legislature shows a peak in the percentage 
                of female deputies <b class="red-text">(73%)</b> with higher education degrees. 
                In conclusion, while there are differences in the average percentages of higher 
                education degrees between male and female deputies, both genders exhibit fluctuations
