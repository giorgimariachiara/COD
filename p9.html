                    <p class="capital">
                Legislative gender quotas are legal instruments that establish a maximum quota 
                of both genders in <b>political party candidate lists running for elections</b>. The objective is to ensure 
                fair representation of men and women among the candidates, promoting greater gender parity within legislative 
                bodies. Among the 27 EU countries, there are <b>7</b> states that have <b>both 
                legislative</b> and <b>voluntary</b> quotas, <b>3</b> with <b>only legislative</b> quotas in effect, <b>13</b> with only <b>voluntary</b> quotas, and
                <b>5 where no quota system</b> has been implemented to date.

                    quota system</b> has been implemented to date.
                     This initiative has proven to be effective. Women in <b>European parliaments</b> have 
                     increased from an average of <b>20.9% in 2004 to 31.7% in 2019</b>.

            <div class="col-3 artQ2">
            <p>
            This progress coincides with the period during which many EU countries implemented
            gender quota laws, including Italy (Law 165 of 2017). While the <b> path to full
            gender equality is still long</b>, this increase is a positive sign of the <b>ongoing change</b>.
            However, there are <b>several pending issues</b> to consider. <b>Firstly</b>, it's necessary to 
            acknowledge that the quota system does not seem to have positively influenced
            <b>women's access</b> to key positions of <b>legislative power</b>. For instance, in Italy, 
            only <b>10</b> out of <b>28</b> committee chairs and <b>5</b>out of <b>17</b> <b>parliamentary group leaders</b>
            in the Chamber and Senate are women.

                <h6><b class="red-text">Italy's Rosato Law</b>: Advancing Gender Representation in Politics</span></h6>
                <p class="capital">
                 In Italy, the Rosato Law, officially known as<b> Law 165 of November 3, 2017</b>,
                  commonly referred to as <b class="red-text">Rosatellum bis</b> or simply Rosatellum, 
                    governs the <b>election</b> of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the <b>Italian Republic</b>. 
                    This <b class="red-text">electoral law</b> incorporates measures to <b>ensure gender representation</b>, including 
                    the following <b>three conditions</b>:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Each party or coalition <b>cannot have more than 60% candidates of the same gender 
                        in single-member constituencies</b>, which applies nationally for the Chamber and regionally for the Senate.</li>
                        <li>Each party <b>cannot have more than 60% top candidates of the same gender in the proportional part</b>,
                             again following national criteria for the Chamber and regional criteria for the Senate.</li>
                        <li> Candidates in multi-member <b>lists must be alternated by gender</b>. </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-3 artQ4">
                <p>
                If the criteria are not met, the affected lists are <b>not admitted </b>(Art. 1, comma 10 e).
                In addition to these quotas, political parties also implement <b class="red-text">voluntary quotas</b> based on
                their own statutes and regulations. These are commitments made by parties to ensure
                equitable inclusion of women and men, both in <b>electoral lists</b> (as an extra effort
                beyond national law) and within <b>party roles</b>. In some cases, these are recommendations,
                while in others, they serve as requirements. Among the parties represented in parliament,
                the <b>Democratic Party is the only one that has established voluntary quotas, requiring a 
                50% female presence in its electoral lists</b>.</p>

            <div class="col-3">
                <h6>Italy's <b class="red-text">Mixed Electoral System</b></h6>

                <p class="capital">               
                    In Italy, is used a mixed electoral system. <b>37% </b>of seats are allocated through a <b class="red-text"> majoritarian
                    system</b>, where the candidate with one more vote wins (<b>single-member</b> constituencies). Meanwhile, 
                    <b>63%</b> of seats are distributed <b class="red-text">proportionally, based on the percentages of votes obtained</b> by different parties
                    (<b>multi-member</b> constituencies). In the 2018 elections for the Chamber of Deputies, 40% of candidates
                    in each coalition's 232 single-member constituencies had to be women. There were also 63 multi-member
                    constituencies, and electoral lists followed the proportional system.

            <h6> Navigating Gender Balance in <b class="red-text">Single-Member Constituencies</b> </h6>
            <p class="capital">At the outset, gender quotas are consistently observed; however, the data
             indicates that <b>the selection of male or female candidates in single-member 
            constituencies is meticulously planned.</b>
            This strategic consideration stems from the fact that party leaders, 
            who often happen to be male, are the ones responsible for determining 
            electoral lists. Consequently, <b>male party leaders tend to favor male candidates</b>, 
            contributing to this strategic decision-making process.Parties are acutally aware of the specific areas where they will be competing, 
            and considering that the electoral districts are relatively small in size, the 
            strategy is, to facilitate male candidates for constituencies considered to be armoured; 
            those in which victory is considered almost certain due to a historical issue (such as the so-called 
            'red regions' for the centre-left), the pool of voters and the inferior notoriety of the opponent are
             considered safe constituencies. On the other hand, for the more uncertain territories, with less
            likelihood of majority victory, a woman is nominated.
            The 2018 elected at the Camera dei deputati are male 150 (65%) and the woman are 82 (35%). 
            Moreover, as for the runners-up, we see that there are 130 men, i.e. fewer than those who won, and 106 women, 
            far more than those elected.</p>

            <div class="col-5">
                <h6> Gender Dynamics in  <b class="red-text"> Multi-Member Constituencies</b> and multiple nominations </h6>
                <p class="capital">
            For what concern the multi-nominal constituencies (63 in the chamber of deputies in 2018), 
            the electoral law provides proportionality between the votes received by each party and the seats 
            obtained as a result. As we have said, the lists are blocked, at least 40% of the candidates must be women, 
            with mandatory gender alternation. For this reason, in contrast to the single-member, for the multi-nominal 
            constituencies, the most uncertain constituencies will see a man as the leader. Sacrificing a female runner-up 
            is a lower price to pay. On the other hand, in the most easily placed constituencies, female leaders multiply,
             so that the second candidates in the electoral list, a man, can also be elected.
            The issue becomes more intricate when it comes to multiple nominations. The law provides that all parties are 
            entitled to nominate the same person in five multi-nominal constituencies and one single-nominal constituency.
             A manoeuvre that, on the one hand, opens up the possibility for small parties to hope for at least one seat, 
             and on the other hand favours the strategies of those with more power. In fact, often the name of the same leading 
             woman appears in the electoral lists of five (generally armoured) constituencies, the result? One woman will
              be elected and the others will be men, due to the system of gender alternation.
