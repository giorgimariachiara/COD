                    <p class="capital">
                Legislative gender quotas are legal instruments that establish a maximum quota 
                of both genders in <b>political party candidate lists running for elections</b>. The objective is to ensure 
                fair representation of men and women among the candidates, promoting greater gender parity within legislative 
                bodies. Among the 27 EU countries, there are <b>7</b> states that have <b>both 
                legislative</b> and <b>voluntary</b> quotas, <b>3</b> with <b>only legislative</b> quotas in effect, <b>13</b> with only <b>voluntary</b> quotas, and
                <b>5 where no quota system</b> has been implemented to date.

                     This initiative has proven to be effective. Women in <b>European parliaments</b> have 
                     increased from an average of <b>20.9% in 2004 to 31.7% in 2019</b>.

            This progress coincides with the period during which many EU countries implemented
            gender quota laws, including Italy (Law 165 of 2017). While the <b> path to full
            gender equality is still long</b>, this increase is a positive sign of the <b>ongoing change</b>.
            However, there are <b>several pending issues</b> to consider. <b>Firstly</b>, it's necessary to 
            acknowledge that the quota system does not seem to have positively influenced
            <b>women's access</b> to key positions of <b>legislative power</b>. For instance, in Italy, 
            only <b>10</b> out of <b>28</b> committee chairs and <b>5</b>out of <b>17</b> <b>parliamentary group leaders</b>
            in the Chamber and Senate are women.

                <h6><b class="red-text">Italy's Rosato Law</b>: Advancing Gender Representation in Politics</span></h6>
                <p class="capital">
                 In Italy, the Rosato Law, officially known as<b> Law 165 of November 3, 2017</b>,
                  commonly referred to as <b class="red-text">Rosatellum bis</b> or simply Rosatellum, 
                    governs the <b>election</b> of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the <b>Italian Republic</b>. 
                    This electoral law incorporates measures to ensure gender representation, including 
                    the following three conditions:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Each party or coalition cannot have more than 60% candidates of the same gender 
                        in single-member constituencies, which applies nationally for the Chamber and regionally for the Senate.</li>
                        <li>Each party cannot have more than 60% top candidates of the same gender in the proportional part,
                             again following national criteria for the Chamber and regional criteria for the Senate.</li>
                        <li> Candidates in multi-member lists must be alternated by gender. </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-3">
                <p>
                If the criteria are not met, the affected lists are not admitted (Art. 1, comma 10 e).
                In addition to these quotas, political parties also implement voluntary quotas based on
                their own statutes and regulations. These are commitments made by parties to ensure
                equitable inclusion of women and men, both in electoral lists (as an extra effort
                beyond national law) and within party roles. In some cases, these are recommendations,
                while in others, they serve as requirements. Among the parties represented in parliament,
                the Democratic Party is the only one that has established voluntary quotas, requiring a 
                50% female presence in its electoral lists.</p>
